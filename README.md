# Machine Learning Project Portfolio

## About The Project 
- This project is collection of a series of small machine learning projects including classification, regression,
non-supervised learning, and some data collection projects. It's a self-challenge portfolio for 2021 summer season. 


- All projects are implemented either on Jupyter Notebook or Google Collab

## Built With 
* [TensorFlow 2.3.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
